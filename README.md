# Prompt4README

## Description
Prompt4README is a Python-based tool designed to generate a comprehensive code prompt file by recursively exploring a specified directory for files with specific programming language extensions. The tool reads the content of these files and compiles them into a structured text file, which can be used for various purposes such as documentation, code analysis, or AI training.

Additionally, the README below was created using the prompt generated by this project.ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—

## Suggestion

DeepSeek is an better choice for handling complex tasks due to its significantly larger input capacity.

## Features
- **Recursive Directory Exploration**: The tool can explore directories recursively to find files with specific extensions.
- **File Content Extraction**: Extracts and compiles the content of files with supported extensions.
- **Customizable Path**: Allows users to specify a directory path via command-line arguments.
- **Output File Generation**: Generates a structured text file containing the code prompts from the identified files.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **argparse**: A Python module used for parsing command-line arguments.
- **os**: A Python module used for interacting with the operating system, particularly for directory and file operations.

## Installation Instructions
To get started with Prompt4README, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasanpekedis/Prompt4README
   cd Prompt4README
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --path /full/path/of/your/project
   ```

## Configuration
The project requires minimal configuration. However, you can customize the following:

- **Directory Path**: Specify the directory path using the `--path` argument when running the script. If not provided, the script will use the current working directory.
- **Supported File Extensions**: Modify the `language_file_types` list in the `main.py` file to include or exclude specific file extensions.

## Usage
To use Prompt4README, simply run the script with the desired directory path:

```bash
python main.py --path /full/path/of/your/project
```

This will generate a file named `prompt_<project_name>.txt` in the current directory, containing the code prompts from all the supported files found in the specified directory.

### Example
Given a project structure like this:

```
/my-project
    /src
        main.py
        utils.py
    /tests
        test_main.py
```

Running the script with `--path /home/user/my-project` will produce a `prompt_my-project.txt` file containing the content of `main.py`, `utils.py`, and `test_main.py`.

### Code Prompt Format
The generated code prompt file will have the following format for each file:

```
###There is file in /path/to/file and it contains the following code:
    <file content>
```

This format ensures that the code is well-documented and easy to reference.
